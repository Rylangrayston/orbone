Orbone = Orbital Drone,  a drone whos fly stuff is free from its payload stuff


The Idea is simple, disconect the payload from the Parts of the a drone that make the lift 
so that when you manuver the drone you dont have to manuver the payload too!

This repo isnt just for quads altho that is its first focus, you could do this with the payload of any craft!

Originaly Shared by Rylan Grayston in an atempt to get more resposive drones for a project involving 3d printing with drones

Everything here is gpl2 or gpl3, freedom respecting.
