here is my to do list for this project, feel free to branch and help me pull these off!

1 render better animaitons of this drone working

2. further explain the variable pich fans and build them into an air foil type wing

3. modle a simular version where instead of a gimbal asembly we simply hug a sphear with roler bearings
sort of like an upside down ball balancing robot 

3.5 place 2 fans on top and below the drone like fins that alow the drone to move from side to side without
tilting. 

4. find someone who has the skill and actualy want to build one of these.
